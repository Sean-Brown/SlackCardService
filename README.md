# SlackCardService
Service for playing card games

Getting started:
- clone the project locally
- configure the typescript compiler to use the settings defined in the tsconfig.json file
- run "npm install" from the command line to install the node modules
- run "tsd install" from the command line to install the typescript definition files

That should be enough to get started, but it's also good to setup the test runners:
- Mocha: configure Mocha to run the tests in the ./spec/Node directory
- Node.js: configure a Node.js test runner to run the tests in the ./spec/SlackCardService directory

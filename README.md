# SlackCardService
Service for playing card games

Getting started:
- clone the project locally
- configure the typescript compiler to use the settings defined in the tsconfig.json file
- run "npm install" from the command line to install the node modules
- run "typings install" from the command line to install the typescript definition files

Check under the /spec directory if you're interested in setting up the tests

If you get errors, check the test output and make sure that the version of node and npm specified 
that were used when running the tests are the same version as node and npm in package.json under the 
'engines' section
